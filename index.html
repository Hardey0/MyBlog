    <header>Why i Want To Be a Front-End Developer and How HNG Wil Help Me achieve My Goals</header>
    <article>
        <p>The journey to become a frontend developerhas been shaped by my deep interest in technology and design. What fascinates me the most about frontend development is the blend creativity and problem solving it involves. The ability to to bring an idea to life through code,creating engaging and interactive expericences for users, motivates me everyday</p>
        <p>My passion for frontend development started when I built my first basic webpage. That small achievement sparked my curiosity and led me to explore more advanced concepts like JavaScript frameworks, responsive design, and user experience principles. Over time, I have worked on personal projects that challenged me to think critically, debug efficiently, and continuously improve my skills. However,
        I recognize that there is still much to learn, especially in working on large-scale applications and collaborating within a professional team.</p>
         <p>The HNG internship program provides structured mentorship and exposure to real-world development challenges. Through this program, I aim to improve my coding skills, gain hands-on experience with industry-standard frameworks, and learn how to work efficiently in a team environment. Collaboration is an essential part of software development, 
         and I look forward to refining my ability to communicate and contribute effectively.</p>
         <p>My goals for this internship include becoming proficient in React.js, learning Next.js, and improving my ability to solve real-life projects that require innovative thinking. I also want to strengthen my understanding of UI/UX principles to ensure that the applications I build are both functional and visually appealing.</p>
        <p>I plan to achieve these goals by fully engaging with the mentorship and guidance offered by HNG. I will remain committed to every project, focusing not just on coding but also on project management and teamwork. With every challenge, 
        I am confident that I will gain the knowledge and experience needed to succeed as a frontend developer</p>
